* If you'd like to add a newsletter subscribe box to the theme, Freezer's styles support an embed code from MailChimp. Log in at MailChimp, and go to Lists > Signup Forms > Embedded Forms. Click on the Naked form. Remove all fields except required fields. Grab the ensuing embed code.

Add this code to the Email Settings option in the WordPress customization menu.

## Notes

Thumbnail -> The theme was built to support square thumbnails at 200 pixels by 200 pixels. You can edit your thumbnail settings in Settings > Media.

Custom post types -> The theme includes special styles for quote posts.

Slidebar on scroll -> The sticky, disappaearing sidebar can be populated by adding widgets inside the WordPress menu.

## Thanks

Many thanks to Underscores for the baseline theme, Wistia for some inspiration, Cody House for some javascript code, and Brian Lovin for tips and tricks.
